\strong{NOTE}: Temperature rasters are now assumed by default to be in degrees C and precipitation in mm. 
rasters in degrees C * 10. Worldclim v2 uses degrees C. CHELSA has several options, depending 
on whether rasters are downloaded as floating point or integer. Therefore, there is an argument 
\code{tempScale} to specify the units of temperature, and \code{precipScale} to define precipitation units:

For example:\cr
If using worldclim v1 data where temperature is in degrees C * 10, specify 
\code{tempScale = 10}.\cr
If using worldclim v2 where temperature is in degrees C, specify \code{tempScale = 1}.\cr
For CHELSA, read the documentation and carefully examine the rasters. 

If a function does not have the \code{tempScale} argument, then the function is not sensitive
to the units of the input temperature rasters.


Of course, it is also perfectly acceptable to leave \code{tempScale = 1} and \code{precipScale = 1} 
and modify the input rasters yourself. 


The main function for generating ENVIREM rasters is \code{\link{generateEnvirem}}.
